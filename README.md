# Fortnte-Structs

I know I have the worst project names.<br>
This code is kinda very messy, but it works.<br>
Tested on 1.7.2, 1.8, 1.9, 2.4.2, 2.5, 3.5, 4.1, 4.41, 5.10, 6.10, 6.21, 6.30, 7.40, 8.20, 9.40, 10.40, 12.61, 15.30, 20.20<br>
To create console on 15.3, it took 823.15ms (old).<br>
The default project, just creates console.

# KNOWN BUGS

- Versions are just cursed on 2.4.2 and below (this is due to them using "Next", "Live", and "Cert") (but they do work).
- Missing s16-s18 patterns.
- Function function broke.

# TODO

- Add finding functions through the members instead of objects.
